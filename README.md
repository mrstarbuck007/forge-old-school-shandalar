# Forge: Shandalar - "The First 10 Years" Edition

This is a fork of the official **[Forge MTG Engine](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge)** adventure mode, crafted to recreate a nostalgic "Old-School" Shandalar adventure mode experience, focusing on the golden age of Magic: The Gathering between 1993-2003.

This version updates Forge's Shandalar campaign to primarily use cards with the original ("old-border") frames, focusing on sets from **Alpha through Scourge (up to May 2003)**.

## Modifications

This fork includes changes to:

*   **Card Restrictions:** The default Shandalar format is restricted to old-border sets.
*   **Enemy Decks:** All enemy decks have been reimagined for an authentic old-school experience. The initial decklists were developed by a complex multi-AI-agent framework and continue to be refined through playtesting. At least 30-40 decks have been manually reviewed and improved, including all boss decks.
*   **Shop Inventories & Rewards:** Adjusted to fit the old-school theme and card pool.
*   **Core Code Fixes:** Includes modifications to the core Forge code (`GameFormat.java` and adventure GUI code) to correctly handle reprinted cards within restricted formats, ensuring they appear in shops and rewards as intended when their original printing is allowed.

## Features

*   Authentic "golden-age" of MTG feeling with only old-border cards in Shandalar.
*   Boosters available in shops for many old-border sets.
*   Power 9 cards are extremely rare and only obtainable from specific encounters.
